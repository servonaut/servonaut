## How it works

servonaut simplifies server management in three easy steps:

1. Link Your Repository: Start by linking your code repository. servonaut seamlessly integrates with your existing workflow, setting the stage for efficient deployment.

2. Automated Setup: Once linked, servonaut automatically sets up your project. It handles all dependencies and necessary security measures, ensuring your server is optimally configured without manual intervention.

3. Monitor and Scale: Post-deployment, servonaut provides robust monitoring tools. Keep track of your application's performance and scale effortlessly as your needs grow, all through an intuitive dashboard.

With servonaut, you get a streamlined, automated, and user-friendly approach to server management and application deployment.

**Architecture**
